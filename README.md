## 1: The Relationship Between Technology and Society

### Text Examination 

Introduction

> Recent scholarship aimed at understanding the relationship between technology and society has focused on two sets of arguments that can be labeled technological determinism and social construction. The technological determinist argument comes in many forms, but the articulation most useful for this section is the claim that the introduction of new technologies produces direct and unalterable social changes.

Example for technological determinism:

> a technological determinist might argue that the Internet will lead to greater democracy because it creates the capacity for people around the world to communicate with one another with ease and without the intervention of policies.

Another example for determinism:

> Advertisers love to play on the idea of technological determinism by suggesting that their products will inevitably
> lead to certain kinds of outcomes, e.g., the sexy car that assures that the owner will get the girl, or the handy kitchen appliance that will produce tasty, gourmet meals with little effort.

Technological determinism assumes that development of technology is unaffected by humans. Here is the quote for this argument:

> Technological determinism presumes that the development of technology is unaffected (or affected very little) by social and political forces and that the technologies that we have today are simply the latest step in the linear progression of science and engineering. Technologically deterministic arguments present technology as a powerful force that requires people and institutions to behave in certain ways.

Social constructivist argument is a direct challenge to the technological determinism.

> Social Constructivists contend that technological development
> has no natural or logical order of progression and is not out of human control.
> Instead, they maintain that society (through interest groups, laws, the economy, political
> decisions, etc.) shapes and directs technology in every phase of its development—
> from conception to production to use (or even non-use).

Social constructivists thinks that t. determinism is dangerous since it pushes out the social forces.

> Technological determinism leads people to believe that a given future is inescapable and allows individuals to abdicate responsibility for controlling the direction of technology. To counter this idea Social Constructivists demonstrate how individuals and groups—engineers, corporations, regulatory agencies, lawyers, politicians etc.— contribute to the direction of technological development.

What is technology?

> Technology is not simply an assemblage of mechanical and electrical pieces; rather it is complex systems of people, relationships, and artifacts. ... the idea that technology is a cluster of material objects, social practices, social relationships, and social organization.

An example about why technology is a system:

> Viewing technologies merely as physical objects is like trying to understand a chess piece separately
> from the game, the thirty-one other pieces, the board, the players, and the rules.

Introduction to the concept of **_'sociotechnical system'_ **

> To understand how technologies are developed, what they mean, and how they are used, it is best to focus on what we will call, ‘sociotechnical systems’—assemblages of things, people, practices, and meanings.

What is sociotechnical system?:

> The device itself is not without meaning, but its purpose, value, and implications are best understood in its broader sociotechnical context.

for better understanding, check this air bag example(or just pass the example):

> Consider the safety air bag in an automobile. It can be seen as a system of sensors, an inflator, and a bag, but this tells one very little about why it was created, what it does, or even how it works. The sociotechnical system of an air bag includes the numerous relationships the device has with people and other devices. For instance, the modern air bag is meaningless if not viewed in the context of modern transportation, automobiles, and car collisions. Its purpose cannot be understood without looking at how insurance companies encouraged its development, how government regulations shaped its design, and how engineers had certain users in mind when they built it. The air bag can work only when there are automobile manufacturers and distributors,
> a road system, and drivers with certain habits.

last quote:

> If one wants to influence the direction of technology and society, one must first understand their relationship.

### Related Questions to the Text: 

1. Are technological determinism and social constructivism incompatible? How might they work together?
2. Which of the pieces in section I can be characterized as technologically deterministic? Why?
3. Which technologies are still ‘‘in the making’’ today, that is, which are still in the stage of interpretive flexibility?
4. Which current technologies have the momentum that Hughes describes? Are there technologies that would be difficult to change or replace (except around the edges) because so many individuals and groups have invested in them and/or rely upon them?
5. What are the major factors influencing the development of new technologies? What are the major factors influencing the development of society today?

### Presentation Examination 

#### Substantivism

shares determinism’s skepticism regarding the human control over the development of technology agency. However, technology is not neutral. 

It is value-laden: how we make and use our tools shapes our values and way of life in ways that are ultimately not under human control.

#### Critical Theory 

don't know for now...

### Comparison 

#### Technological determinism

- Technology determines society, society does not influence society
- Only technological factors, determine the success of failure of a technology
- Successful technologies are inherently superior and their success is evidence of that; failed technologies are inherently inferior.

#### Social Constructivism

- There are many ways wherein society influences technology
- Social factors guide (what counts as) the success or failure of a technology
- Successful technologies can be better and failed ones can be worse, but this is not the explanation of their development.

## 2: Actor-Network Theory 

### Text Examination

Technology and Science = _technoscience_ 

#### - ANT and Materialism of ANT

What is ANT:

> ANT represents technoscience as the creation of larger and stronger networks. Just as a political actor assembles alliances that allow him or her to maintain power, so do scientists and engineers. However, the actors of ANT are heterogeneous in that they include both human and non-human entities, with no methodologically significant distinction between them.

What is the activity of technoscience:

> The activity of technoscience, then, is the work of understanding the interests of a variety of actors, and
> translating those interests so that the actors work in agreement (Callon 1986; Callon and Law 1989). That is, in order to form part of a network, an actor must be brought to bear on other actors, so they must be brought together. Moreover, they must be brought together so as to work together, which may mean changing the ways in which they act. By being moved and changed, interests are translated in both place and form. In this way, actors are made to act; as originally defined, the actors of ANT are actants, things made to act.  			

Some quotes:

> ANT is a materialist theory. It reduces even the “social” to the material,both inside and outside of science (Latour 2005).

> We can see that, while ANT is a general theory, it is one that explains the centrality of science and technology to the idea of modernity (Latour 1993). Technologies reshape the field of agency, because people delegate
> agency to them. Science and technology explicitly engage in crossing back and forth between objects and representations, creating more situations in which humans and non-humans affect each other. Science and technology are responsible for the contemporary world, because more than any other activities they have mixed humans and non-humans together, allowing a dramatic expansion of the social world. Science and technology have brought non-humans into the human world, to shape, replace, and enlarge social organizations, and have brought human meanings and organizations to the non-human world, to create new alignments of forces (Latour 1994).

A good example and explanation of  _*''black box*_ :

> “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking
> about them.

ANT is a materialist theory. Here another explanation for the materialism of ANT:

> Representing both human and non-human actors, and treating them in the same relational terms, is one way of prompting full analyses, analyses that do not discriminate against any part of the ecologies of scientific facts and technological objects. It does not privilege any particular set of variables, because every variable depends upon others. Networks confront each other as wholes, and to understand their successes and failures STS has to study the wholes (and the parts) of those networks.

#### - Objections to ANT

##### Practices and culture :

> Practices and cultures provide the context and structure for technoscientific opportunism. But because ANT treats humans and non-humans on the same footing, and because it adopts an externalized view of actors, it does not pay attention to such distinctively human and apparently subjective factors as cultures and practices.
> Cultures and cultural networks do not fit neatly into the network framework offered by ANT.

For example some judgements like trust is subjective so they cannot be evaluated under ANT.

##### problems of agency 

> In principle, ANT is entirely symmetrical around the human/non-human divide. Non-humans can appear to act in exactly the same way as do humans – they can have interests, they can enroll others... Critics, though, argue that humans and non-humans are crucially different. Humans have,and most non-humans do not have, intentionality, which is necessary for action on traditional accounts of agency. To treat humans and non-humans
> symmetrically, ANT has to deny that intentionality is necessary for action, and thus deny that the differences between humans and non-humans are important for the theory overall.

##### problems of realism

> Even if ANT assumes that scientists in some sense define or construct the properties of the so-called natural world, it takes their interests seriously. That is, even if an object’s interests can be manipulated, they resist
> that manipulation, and hence push back against the network. This type of picture assumes a reality that is prior to the work of scientists, engineers, and any other actors. Latour says, “A little bit of constructivism takes you
> far away from realism; a complete constructivism brings you back to it”.

##### problems of the stability of objects and actions

I didn't understand fully, but I think it is saying that same experiment with same equipment(or laboratory) can result different in different trials which indicates that the objects are not stabilized.

### Presentation Examination

ANT seeks to explain everything that is presented as exclusively “social” as tied to the material world, both on the inside and and the outside of science. This is called “generalized symmetry”, which seeks to explain when the social and the natural are separated and when they are joined together. This does not happen magically but is the result of work constantly being done. Usually it remains invisible, ANT seeks to show it.

Its method is to follow the formation of networks – follow the network! and their ability to enroll actors by making alliances, perform translation and delegate actions to artefacts. These are not sequential (step 1, 2, 3) but happen throughout the network.

1. Enrolment of humans and non-humans (non-humans as agents)
2. Translation: how minute details of data in science end up as higher representations (new “forms” like kerosene, microbes, colors etc.)
3. Delegation: how highly heterogeneous networks create patterns that generate effects (like organizations, inequality, power, paradigm shifts etc.) 

#### Biopolitics 

Definitions:

> 1. The ability to intervene directly into “the body”, which includes the rate of birth, longevity, environmental conditions & urbanism, sanity, illness, reproduction and so forth.
> 2. Such intervention changes how power is exercised and politics are practices as they result in populations being placed under surveillance, training them, using them, and, if need be, punishing them.

### My Questions 

- I understand how non-humans are brought into human earth(with microscopes for example) but did not get the reverse of it.
- I did not really get the problems of agency.
- I did not really get the problems of realism.
- It is better to check problems part again. 
- What is biopolitics(according to presentations)!!
- Check three steps of the network again.
- What is Biopolitics?? Look to the presentation.

## 3: The Cybernetic Moments

### Text Examination

information age:

> During contentious meetings filled with brilliant arguments, rambling digressions, and disciplinary posturing, the cybernetics group shaped a language of feedback, control, and information that transformed the idiom of the biological and social sciences, sparked the invention of information technologies, and set the intellectual foundation for what came to be called the information age.

Margaret Mead:

> It might seem odd to today’s readers that Margaret Mead sat in a prominent place at the now-famous Macy conferences and that she would be remembered a half-century later as one of the founders of cybernetics.

Why she was there?

> They thought cybernetic models could realistically explain the behavior of humans and society because they contained the information-feedback loops that existed in all organisms.

> Cybernetics has split into two subfields. First-order cybernetics—based on the work of Wiener and McCulloch—
> is a systems modeling discipline with a professional home in the IEEE Society on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics. Second-order cybernetics—based on the work of Bateson and von Foerster—leads a more precarious existence as a radical epistemology in the American Society for Cybernetics and in the journal
> Cybernetics and Human Knowing.

> They describe the taken-for-granted belief that cell phones, personal computers, and the Internet are creating a new economic and social order.

> The Cybernetics Moment examines the intellectual and cultural history of the information discourses of the Cold War, the latest of which celebrates how the merger of computers and communications is creating the next stage
> in American civilization: the information age.

What is cybernetics?:

> a mathematical theory of control; automation; computerization; a theory of communication; the study of analogies between humans and machines; and a philosophy explaining the mysteries of life. To the general public, Boulanger noted, cybernetics “conjures up visions of some fantastic world of the future peopled
> by robots and electronic brains!” His favorite definition was the “science of robots.” Cybernetics was a staple of science fiction and a fad among artists, musicians, and intellectuals in the 1950s and 1960s. Writer
> James Baldwin recalled that the “cybernetics craze” was emblematic of the period for him.

### Text Examination

What is educational data science?

> educational data science is a hybrid of data scientific practices drawing from statistics, computer science, information science, and machine learning, combined with expertise in psychology and neuroscience from the existing field of the ‘learning sciences’

> The article consists of three genealogical case studies exploring how biological, psychological and
> neurological knowledges of children are being generated through emerging educational data science
> practices and then projected into new digitally enacted ‘biopedagogies’, ‘psychopedagogies’, and ‘neuropedagogies’.
> It explores, first, how the biophysiological body of the child is translated into biophysical
> data through health-tracking devices worn on the body, and how knowledges of the biological child are
> from there converted into new biopedagogies (or body pedagogies) intended to encourage children
> to undertake data-driven practices of bodily optimisation. Second, it examines how the psychological
> and affective experiences of the child are captured by emotion-sensing devices, and how psychological
> knowledge of the child is then used to inform the creation of new psychopedagogies of emotional
> maximisation. And third, it explores how emerging understandings of the neurological functioning of
> the child’s brain, defined according to neuroscientific insights about the ‘learning brain’, are leading to
> the production of new kinds of neurocomputational devices that can be embedded into new neuropedagogies
> of brain empowerment.

> It was Michel Foucault who brought the term biopolitics into circulation. For Foucault biopolitics signified
> ‘the entry of phenomena particular to the life of the human species into the order of knowledge
> and power, into the sphere of political techniques’ (

> As such, the
> specific biopolitics associated with biotechnical innovation focuses the expert identification, classification,
> and administration of individuals, who are understood to be amenable to bodily, psychological
> and neurological optimisation. Biotechnologies for the modification of living beings mean the body is
> increasingly viewed as ‘molecular software that can be read and rewritten’

biopedagogies: Track children with devices like smart watches and measure their body statistics like heart beat, physical activity monitoring.

Psychopedagogies: Track emotional activity with some personal devices. Considers children's characters too. Eye Cameras. Face reading technologies. 

Neuropedagogies: Measure student's brain activity in real time. Monitor blood flow in the brain etc.

## 5: Developing a framework for responsible innovation

### Text Examination

> Research in Science and Technology Studies (STS) suggests thatconceptions of responsibility should build on the understand-ing that science and technology are not only technically but alsosocially and politically constituted

> If we take these questions to represent aspects of societalconcern and interest in research and innovation, responsible inno-vation can be seen as a way of embedding deliberation on thesewithin the innovation process. The four dimensions of responsi-ble innovation we propose (anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion andresponsiveness) provide a framework for raising, discussing andresponding to such questions.
